# Welcome to the Research Project Workshop Series

The OHSU Library is very pleased that you have decided to join us for individual or all (woot, boot campers!) meetings for this series. We hope that you find the experience rewarding. The workshops are designed to cover aspects of the research process that are typically learned while "on-the-job". But who wants that?! Hey, we all know that lots of time and resources are at stake...not to mention all the chatter about research rigor and reproducibility. 

# Goals
In an effort to make your efforts more effective and efficient, throught this series we will work together to (i) raise awareness about some of the tricky parts of research - the fewer surprises, the better and (ii) develop more functional procedures and tricks that you can build into your work that should help increase productivity AND strengthen your research program.

All of the materials for the workshop are here in GitHub and you will be oriented to GitHub as a first step. If you have any questions or comments that you are comfortable sharing with the group, please submit them via the GitHub Issues feature (found in the menu items above). 

# Code of Conduct
We want everyone to feel conmfortable and confident in our learning spaces. Thus, for these workshops, we will follow a code of conduct. INSERT CODE OF CONDUCT HERE

# Individual Workshop Content & Schedule
The content of each workshop is designed to be a time for those engaged in research to bring their computer (or you may borrow one from the Library if needed) and parts of their research in order to dive into the material and put what's learned into practice.
