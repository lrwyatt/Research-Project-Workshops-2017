# Welcome

The OHSU Library is very pleased that you have decided to join us for individual or all (woot, boot campers!) meetings for this series. We hope that you find the experience rewarding. The workshops are designed to address elements of doing research that may not be explicitly covered in formal coursework, aspects of the research process that are typically learned while "on-the-job". Who wants that?! Hey, we all know that lots of time and resources are at stake...not to mention all the chatter about research rigor and reproducibility.  

# Goals
The goal of the workshops is to allow researchers the hands-on time dedicated for addressing topics like research data management (RDM) fundamentals, experimental design, and scientific communication within their work. You might think of this like a working group. In an effort to make your efforts more effective and efficient, throught this series we will work together to (i) raise awareness about some of the tricky parts of research - the fewer surprises, the better and (ii) develop more functional procedures and tricks that you can build into your work that should help increase productivity AND strengthen your research program.

# Code of Conduct
We want everyone to feel conmfortable and confident in our learning spaces. Thus, for these workshops, workshop participants are expected to follow the following code of conduct: We value the involvement of everyone in this Library. We are committed to creating a friendly and respectful place for learning and contributing. All participants are expected to show respect and courtesy to others.

# Workshop Contents & Schedule
The content of each workshop is designed to be a time for those engaged in research to bring their computer (or you may borrow one from the Library if needed) and parts of their research in order to dive into the material and put what's learned into practice. All of the materials for the workshop are here in GitHub and you will be oriented to GitHub as a first step. If you have any questions or comments that you are comfortable sharing with the group, please submit them via the GitHub Issues feature.
