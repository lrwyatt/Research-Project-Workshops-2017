The OHSU Library has developed a workshop series to address elements of doing research that may not be explicitly covered in formal coursework. The goal of the workshops is to allow researchers the hands-on time dedicated for addressing topics like research data management (RDM) fundamentals, experimental design, and scientific communication within their work. You might think of this like a working group.
